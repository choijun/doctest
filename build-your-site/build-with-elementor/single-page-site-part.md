{% hint style="warning" %}
Important: Only pages that use Default Template will have the Single Page Template applied to them, even if they otherwise meet the Display Conditions criteria. Pages that use Canvas or Full Width template (or any template other than Default) will not have the Single Page Template applied to them.


{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Important: The single page template is meant to apply a design to the page using the dynamic widgets and NOT to add content (image widget, text widgets, etc) directly to the template.
